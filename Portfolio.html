				<h2><a href="https://github.com/jfwedlick/Midterm-project">Library Project</a></h2>
				<p>
					This is a C# console app that functions as a library. There are a hundred books to choose from. They've got titles and authors. Check them in, check them out, burn down the library. 
					You've been to libraries before, so you should know how it goes. This was the midterm project that Frank and his peers submitted for the Grand Circus C# After Hours Bootcamp in Fall of 2023.
