				<h2>What is this website?</h2>
				<p>Greetings, weary traveler. You have reached Frank's webpage. This is, more or less, a place for me to practice html and laugh at my own stupid jokes. It's got a kind of fun retro late 90s website look because I suck at html. But hey, sucking at something has never stopped me before, and it's not like I'm going to stop now. I think that's enough words for this section.</p>
				<h2>Developing!</h2>
				<p>Like I said, I suck at HTML. I know it's important and whatnot, hence why I'm doing this, but sheesh this is rough. I'm actually pretty good at C# if I do say so myself, but from what I've been told this too is an important part of the learning process because building successful apps does involve the use of HTML.</p>
				<h2>I find all of this very overwhelming.</h2>
				<p>Just have fun and be yourself. :)</p>
				<h2>Are there any other sections?</h2>
				<p>Not after this one.</p>
