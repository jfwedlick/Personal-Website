				<h2>About the Author</h2>
				<p>
					Frank was born in Detroit, Michigan an otherwise uneventful day in May of 1992. He attended college at the University of Michigan-Dearborn where he majored in English and minored in German and playing euchre. 
					Afterwards he had what he lovingly refers to as a "quarter-life crisis" during which time he abandoned his plan to teach high school and ended up spending the next almost-decade in the mortgage industry. 
					That's worked out pretty well for him so far, but now he's on to his next adventure which is the exciting and fast-paced world of software development. 
					Through the magic of the Internet, which has been referred to by great intellectuals of our time as "a series of tubes," we find ourselves here, on this webpage.
